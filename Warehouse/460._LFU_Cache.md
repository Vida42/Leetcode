思路：

用一个字典保存key->node关系，实现O(1)get和put

用一个字典保存freq->DoubleLinkedList关系，维护lfu

每个DoubleLinkedList内都是DoubleNode

同时用一个变量保存当前最小freq值，方便pop


> **各种操作的时间复杂度都是O(1)**

        Three things to maintain:
        
        1. a dict, named as `self._node`, for the reference of all nodes given key.
           That is, O(1) time to retrieve node given a key.
           
        2. Each frequency has a doubly linked list, store in `self._freq`, where key
           is the frequency, and value is an object of `DLinkedList`
        
        3. The min frequency through all nodes. We can maintain this in O(1) time, taking
           advantage of the fact that the frequency can only increment by 1. Use the following
           two rules:
           
           Rule 1: Whenever we see the size of the DLinkedList of current min frequency is 0,
                   the min frequency must increment by 1.
           
           Rule 2: Whenever put in a new (key, value), the min frequency must 1 (the new node)

        1. we maintain the self._minfreq, the minimum possible frequency in cache.
