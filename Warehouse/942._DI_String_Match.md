# 942. DI String Match
> Difficulty = Easy

## 分析

我又又又又又参考别人答案了唉，怎么人家的思路就这么清晰呢？

- Think of available numbers to put as an array of [0, 1, 2, ..., len(S)]
- When you see "I", your safest option is to put lowest(leftmost) number for the next move, so it will always increase
- When you see "D", your safest option is to put highest(rightmost) number for the next move, so it will always decrease
- Don't forget to put latest number when l == r
> A比S多一位

```python
# 140 ms, faster than 29.19%

class Solution:
    def diStringMatch(self, S):
        l, r, arr = 0, len(S), []
        for s in S:
            arr.append(l if s == "I" else r)
            l, r = l + (s == "I"), r - (s == "D")
        return arr + [l]
```


## 总结

还得多做
